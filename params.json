{"name":"DoorPy","tagline":"A Python doorbell application for the Raspberry Pi","body":"### Welcome the DoorPy project webpage.\r\nMy goal of this project was to create a doorbell system using Python (DoorPy) which would alert me when someone is at my door. In addition, I would like to notify people waiting at the door. As I live in an apartment, people (especially delivery guys) would leave in a moment even before I could get to my door. My hopes are that a little screen would keep them mesmerised for long enough, so I can go downstairs. Or simply deny them with a message that I am not around.\r\n\r\nThis project is a work in progress, below is indicated how far I currently am:\r\n- [x] Connect button to GPIO pins RPi.\r\n- [x] Write initial script.\r\n- [ ] Attach Display-O-Tron 3000 (Dot3K).\r\n- [ ] Expand script to output on Dot3K.\r\n- [ ] Adding something smart to notify me!\r\n- [ ] Add networking capabilities between two RPis.\r\n- [ ] Round up.\r\n\r\nI am not at all a developer, I just like Python and use this project as something to learn from. Especially GPIO got my interest (physical computing, yay :sparkles:), as I have never worked with electronics in combination with a Raspberry Pi this seemed like a nice learning experience. I have programmed before, but like I said, not on an epic scale. If you have any comments/advice/questions, just let me know.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\nWhat you will need for this project:\r\n\r\n1. Raspberry Pi (2 if you want to interact [future work])\r\n2. Wireless doorbell (can be found really cheap, I have bought a 'AC Mini wireless door chime QH-832AC')\r\n3. Display-o-Tron 3000 (@[Pimoroni](http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/displayotron-3000))\r\n4. (Optionally) Pibow case to neatly fit your Pi in.\r\n5. (Optionally) Pibow Display-O-Tron case top\r\n  * To also have your joystick free (harhar).\r\n\r\n### Connecting to a Raspberry's GPIO pins\r\nWel *that* was easy... Connect the button to the pins, import the Python library and off you go!\r\n\r\nOkay, hold you horses *before* you fry your Raspberry! Let us get some things straight:\r\n* GPIO?\r\n* RPi pin map\r\n* Connecting\r\n* Using the GPIO library\r\n\r\n### Write initial script.\r\nBacon ipsum dolor amet rump pork chop short loin brisket spare ribs sausage ham.
